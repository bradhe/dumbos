# TODO

This is a list of things that I *could* do next. Pick whatever is most
interesting and run with it, if you ask me.

* Keyboard input
  * Handling interrupts
* Screen buffering
  * Scroll text up when it exceeds total lines.
  * More complicated: Directly editing VGA memory?
    * Changing graphics modes...
* Time handling
  * Get time from BIOS
  * Methods for returning time
  * Benchmarking?
* NIC communication?
  * Handling interrupts
  * TCP/UDP/etc.
* Multitasking
  * Processes
  * Scheduling
  * MM per process
    * VPT
* Memory Management
  * `mem_free`?
  * Kernel-space memory?

That's it!!
